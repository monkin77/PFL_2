## Setup and Execution

## Game Description
*Shi* is a 8x8 board game that can be played by 2 players that take the role of **Ninja** and **Samurai**. Initially, there are 8 pieces per side, set up on the players' first row.  
The main goal of this game is to reduce the enemy army to 4 pieces. To do this, all the pieces move like a *Chess Queen*, that is, an unlimited number of cells in all directions and attack the enemy with **jump attacks**. These attacks can only be made by jumping over a single friendly piece along the path of attack. Any number of unoccupied spaces, including none, may exist on that path. Furthermore, the piece being jumped, must always be an ally and never an enemy. For this reason, attacks can only target the first enemy in the path of attack.
